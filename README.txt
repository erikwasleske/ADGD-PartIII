Active Dwarf Galaxy Database Part III

#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%
- Morphological follow up to the Active Dwarf Galaxy database.
	- search from connections of morphology to AGN selection signature.
	- using Galfit and statmorph, measuring sersic index, finding if they need PSF
	- Previous studies have shown :
		Opticall selected dwarf AGN are biased to disk dominated with pseudo bulges
			(Kimbrell+2021,+2023)
		Variability selected dwarf AGN are diverse in morphologies (Kimbro+2025)
